<h4><b>SocialFix</b> aims to follow an anarchist philosophy</h4>
<p>Hold on if you think "anarchy" means "chaos". We're talking about the anarchist movement here, which has rules and organisation. The best quote to define it is " order without power". On SocialFix, there is authority stuck in a small group of people, nor any hierarchy whatsoever. Any member must have a direct power of decision and is free to contribute to the project according to her/his skills.</p>
