Did you know that 80% of homeless people have access to the internet at least once a week? Without counting all people with a roof but living in hard conditions. That's why it is time to have couchsurfing-like application based on solidarity. This will be socialfix.
<h4><b>SocialFix</b>'s' ultimate goal is to become pointless</h4>
<p>Socialfix consists in a social platform where members in need can find around them other members ready to help them with basic services. The available services fall in 3 categories:
  <ul>
<li>Offering a meal </li>
<li>Offering a shelter for the night</li>
<li>washing services: Shower, toilet, laundry,...</li>
 </ul>
 </p>
<br>
<h4><b>SocialFix</b> is a non-profit, open-source, and ad-free project.</h4>
<p>Anyone is free to consult the sources and reuse them for any project, as long as it is non-profit.</p>

<br>
<h4><b>SocialFix</b> aims to follow an anarchist philosophy</h4>
<p>Hold on if you think "anarchy" means "chaos". We're talking about the anarchist movement here, which has rules and organisation. The best quote to define it is " order without power". On SocialFix, there is no authority stuck in a small group of people, nor any hierarchy whatsoever. Any member must have a direct power of decision and is free to contribute to the project according to her/his skills.</p>
